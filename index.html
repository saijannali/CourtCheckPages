          <h4>
            At CourtCheck, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our
            users. This Privacy Policy outlines the information we request user
            permissions for and how we use it. Information Use:
            <ul>
              <li>
                We request the user's current location to showcase a list of
                basketball courts around them and provide live traffic
                information such as the number of people currently at a certain
                court or the availability of a court.
              </li>
              <li>
                The app allows users to check-in and check-out of the courts, in
                which case we request permission of the user's location data of
                the court and the time of check-in and check-out.
              </li>
            </ul>

            also use this information to personalize the content and advertising
            displayed to users. Sharing of Information:

              <li>
                We do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional or marketing use. However, in the future, if we decide to sell user data to third-party vendors, we will update this Privacy Policy and obtain explicit consent from our users. We will also provide clear opt-out options for those who do not wish to have their data shared with third-party vendors. Additionally, we will only share non-personally identifiable information or aggregate data that cannot be traced back to an individual user.

                We may disclose information as required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal process or protect the safety of our users or the public.
